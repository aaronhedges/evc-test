### Notes to Paul:

* I used the basic Vue-CLI to create a test application with routing, linter, etc
* I used scoped CSS for component specific basic styling but didn't focus too much on this
* For new user registration I put it as First Name and Last Name, since many form completions for users will work better that way (ie when a user is creating their account the browser will automatically fill out these items)
